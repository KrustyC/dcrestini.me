# Personal Website
Hi there! This is the repo for my personal website. The aim of this project is of course to build a website that I can use  as an online portfolio, but it's mainly to have a project where I can experiment development tools and framework as well as external services (like CI/CD system, Cloud Hosting, various webhook). 

## General Info
I decided to create an open source project so that other developers can take inspiration from this website (if they like it) and maybe build their own website using this as a starting point. So feel free to fork the repo!

This website has been built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a JavaScript framework and [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) as a CSS framework. Furthermore [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/) has been used as a module bundler.

## Requirements
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v8.4.0)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (v0.27.5)

## Development
Once clone the repo run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
To run the project in development mode just run `yarn dev` and then open your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Testing
I'd like to add test in a future, but for the moment there is nothing to test, so I think is not worth :)

## Linting
This repo will follow the [airbnb linting style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Contributors
I'll be the only contributor but as I said above, if you want to use this project as a starting point for your own website please feel free to fork the repo :)
