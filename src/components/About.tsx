        Hi! My name is Davide and I love building things for the web. Whether
        it's a landing page, a microservice, or a whole system, I always enjoy
        writing code and solve some problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started coding at High School, when I was 16 and since then, my
        passion for coding and Computer Science in general has kept growing.
        That is why I decided to move to Bologna and study Computer Science at
        the University of Bologna, where I graduated in December 2016. I then
        decided to move London to start my carrer as a web developer. I have
        graduated from the University of Bologna with a Bachelors of Computer
        Science, in 2016 and after that I decided to move to London to start my
        career as a developer.

        A few years forward, and I have had the opportunity to work with and
        meet a lot of great talented people, from across the whole world. During
        this 5 years I have the chance to work across the full stack of
        development, from Database and API design & implemntation, to building
        UI interfaces with React. bla bla bla .....
