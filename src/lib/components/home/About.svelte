        Hi! My name is Davide and I love building things for the web. Whether
        it's a landing page, a microservice, or a whole system, I love working
        with software.... (to improve) I started coding at High School, when I
        was 16 and since then, my passion for coding and Computer Science in
        general has kept growing. That is why I decided to move to Bologna and
        study Computer Science at the University of Bologna, where I graduated
        in December 2016. I then decided to move London to start my carrer as a
        web developer. I have graduated from the University of Bologna with a
        Bachelors of Computer Science, in 2016 and after that I decided to move
        to London to start my career as a developer.

        <br />
        <br />
        A few years forward, and I have had the opportunity to work with and meet
        a lot of great talented people, from across the whole world. During this
        5 years I have the chance to work across the full stack of development, from
        Database and API design & implemntation, to building UI interfaces with React.
        bla bla bla .....
