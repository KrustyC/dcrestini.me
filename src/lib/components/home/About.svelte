        I am a full stack developer with a passion for creating beautiful,
        responsive, and intuitive user interfaces. I have graduated from the
        University of Bologna with a Bachelors of Computer Science, in 2016 and
        after that I decided to move to London to start my career as a
        developer.

        <br />
        <br />

        The almost 5 years I have been working as a developer has taught me a
        lot about the importance of teamwork, communication, and how to work in
        a collaborative environment. I have also learned that I can be a great
        team player and always be open to new ideas.

        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I am a Senior Frontend Engineer, and Tech Lead of the Bookable
        Squad @ Culture Trip. As a Teach Lead I always have to make sure that my
        team has all they need to carry on with their day to day job. If you are
        looking for a holiday, or if you just interested about what me and my amazing
        team do, please heade over to our
